# KAFKITO

Kafkito is a lightwieight message broker. It bears no similarity or inspiration from Kafka, I just thought the name sounded good.

## Build instructions

Run `make build` at the root directory of the project. That's it.

This was built on MacOS, if you're having problems from using a different OS [this tutorial might help](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/building-go-applications-for-different-operating-systems-and-architectures).

## Run instructions

Download the kafkito `bin` directory and put it your path. The binaries where compiled on MacOS, sou you will need to recompile if you're using a different OS (see build instructions).

Then, run the `kafkito help` command for the full specs.

Enjoy!
